# Power-Flows-Study-Project
The following report shows the results obtained by simulating a 14-bus power system using a program developed in the Python programming language, which is capable of solving N-bus systems. Both the voltage profiles for each of the buses and the power flows in all the lines of the system are detailed. The results were obtained using the numerical Gauss-Seidel method.
